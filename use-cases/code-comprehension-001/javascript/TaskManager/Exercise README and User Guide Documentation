## How to Install

Install it globally with npm:

```bash
npm install -g task-cli
```

Check if it worked:

```bash
taskcli --version
```

## Basic Setup

Run this first to set up your preferences:

```bash
taskcli init
```

Set your email for notifications:

```bash
taskcli config set email your.email@example.com
```

## How to Use

### Creating Tasks

Make a new task:

```bash
taskcli add "Fix the login bug"
```

Add a task with a due date:

```bash
taskcli add "Write documentation" --due 2024-01-15
```

### Viewing Tasks

See all your tasks:

```bash
taskcli list
```

See tasks for a specific project:

```bash
taskcli list --project "Website"
```

### Completing Tasks

Mark task as done:

```bash
taskcli complete 5
```

### Working with Projects

Create a new project:

```bash
taskcli project add "Mobile App"
```

Add task to a project:

```bash
taskcli add "Design login screen" --project "Mobile App"
```

### Using Tags

Add tags when creating tasks:

## Prompt 2: Step-by-Step Guide for GitHub Integration

# How to Connect TaskCLI with GitHub

This guide shows you how to link your tasks with GitHub issues so you can manage everything from the command line.

## What You Need First

- TaskCLI installed and working
- A GitHub account
- Access to the repositories you want to connect

## Step 1: Get a GitHub Token

Go to GitHub and create a personal access token:

1. Login to GitHub
2. Click your profile picture → Settings
3. Go to Developer settings → Personal access tokens
4. Click "Generate new token"
5. Name it something like "TaskCLI Integration"
6. Check these permissions:
   - repo (full repository access)
   - read:user (read user info)
7. Click "Generate token"
8. Copy the token right away - GitHub only shows it once

## Step 2: Add Token to TaskCLI

Put your token in TaskCLI:

```bash
taskcli config set githubToken your-token-here
```

Check it worked:

```bash
taskcli config list
```

You should see your token (partially hidden) in the list.

## Step 3: Connect a Project to a Repository

Create or use an existing project:

```bash
taskcli project add "Website Frontend"
```

Link it to your GitHub repo:

```bash
taskcli project link "Website Frontend" --repo "yourname/yourrepo"
```

Make sure it worked:

```bash
taskcli project show "Website Frontend"
```

## Step 4: Link Tasks to Issues

### Import an Issue as a Task

Turn a GitHub issue into a task:

```bash
taskcli github import --repo "yourname/yourrepo" --issue 15
```

### Create Task and Link to Issue

Make a new task connected to an issue:

```bash
taskcli add "Fix navigation" --github-issue 15
```

### Link Existing Task to Issue

Connect a task you already have:

```bash
taskcli link 8 --github-issue 15
```

## Step 5: Keep Everything in Sync

Update tasks from GitHub:

```bash
taskcli github sync
```

Complete a task and close the GitHub issue:

```bash
taskcli complete 8 --push-github
```

See GitHub info for a task:

```bash
taskcli show 8 --github-details
```

## Common Problems

### Authentication Failed

If you get authentication errors:

- Check your token is still valid
- Make sure it has the right permissions
- Try creating a new token

### Repository Not Found

If it says repository not found:

- Check the repo name is correct (username/reponame)
- Make sure you have access to the repo
- Verify your token works with that repo

### Sync Not Working

If changes don't sync:

- Try `taskcli github sync --force`
- Check your internet connection
- Look for error messages with `taskcli log show`

## What's Next

Now you can:

- Set up automatic daily syncs
- Create tasks from new GitHub issues
- Track time on issues
- Generate reports that include GitHub data

## Prompt 3: FAQ Document

### Can I create repeating tasks?

Yes, use the recurring flag:

```bash
taskcli add "Weekly report" --recurring weekly
```

## Exercise Reflection

**Most Challenging Parts**: Writing clear installation instructions was hard because different systems work differently. Also explaining the GitHub integration without making it sound too complicated.

**Prompt Adjustments**: I found that asking for simpler language and more examples helped a lot. Also being specific about the target audience (developers who use command line tools) made the responses better.

**Document Structure**: I learned that FAQs work best when organized by what people actually want to do, not by technical features. Starting with basic questions and moving to advanced ones helps users find what they need.

**Workflow Integration**: This approach would work well for any project. Writing documentation this way helps you think about what users really need to know, not just what the code does. I would use this for README files, setup guides, and help documentation.

## What I Created

1. **Project Choice**: TaskCLI command-line task management tool
2. **README File**: Complete setup and usage guide with examples
3. **Step-by-Step Guide**: How to set up GitHub integration with troubleshooting
4. **FAQ Document**: Common questions organized by user goals, not features

The documentation covers everything a developer would need to start using the tool effectively, with simple language and practical examples.
